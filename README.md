# Web scraping to gain company insights British Airways (BA)

The Customer Sentiment Analysis project for British Airways aims to gain valuable insights into the airline's clientele by analyzing and interpreting customer feedback and comments. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project aims to extract sentiment, identify recurring themes, and uncover patterns and trends within the comments provided by British Airways' customers.

The project begins by collecting a comprehensive dataset of customer comments from compqny's website. These comments represent a diverse range of customer experiences and opinions, providing a rich source of information for analysis.

Using NLP techniques, the text data is preprocessed to remove noise and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. Techniques such as tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and removing stopwords are applied to ensure the text is ready for sentiment analysis.

Sentiment analysis, a key aspect of this project, involves determining the sentiment expressed in each comment, whether positive, negative, or neutral. This process can be performed using pre-trained sentiment analysis models or by developing a custom model trained on labeled data. The sentiment analysis results help understand the overall satisfaction level of British Airways' clients.

By gaining insights from client feedback, British Airways can make data-driven decisions to optimize their services, address customer pain points, and improve overall customer satisfaction. The findings from this project have the potential to guide strategic initiatives, drive operational enhancements, and contribute to the airline's reputation and success in the highly competitive aviation industry.
